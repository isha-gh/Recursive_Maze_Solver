# Recursive_Maze_Solver
This is a maze solver that uses recursion to go from the start to the end of a given maze. 
The start and end of the maze are represented with the
characters + and -, respectively. The first line of the maze file will be the number
of rows and columns, respectively.

As your program moves through the maze the current path is 
also marked with the + character. Any path leading to
a dead end should be marked with the . character.

Upon reaching the end of the maze the program prints a 
message to the screen stating that the maze was solved.
If the program does not find the exit, it is also stated.
All messages, and a print out of the solution, if one is found,
is shown to the screen.
